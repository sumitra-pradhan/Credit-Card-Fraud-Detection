# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

## üîç Objective
To detect fraudulent transactions using supervised learning techniques, focusing on high precision and recall for minority (fraud) class prediction.

## üß† Methodology
Dataset Used: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud dataset
### Data Preprocessing:
Handled class imbalance with SMOTE or undersampling.
Scaled features using StandardScaler.
### Modeling Techniques:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree / Random Forest
XGBoost / LightGBM (if applicable)

### Evaluation Metrics:
Confusion Matrix
Precision, Recall, F1-score
ROC-AUC

### üìà Outcome
Achieved high recall on the minority class with minimal false negatives, optimizing for real-world relevance in financial fraud detection.

## Conclusion
The credit card fraud detection model successfully demonstrated the power of machine learning in handling highly imbalanced datasets, achieving strong recall and precision on the minority class (fraudulent transactions). Through effective data preprocessing, feature scaling, and strategic model selection, the system consistently identified fraudulent behavior while minimizing false positives.
